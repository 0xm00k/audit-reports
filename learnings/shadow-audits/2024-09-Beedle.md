### [S-#] Title (ROOT CAUSE + IMPACT)

**Description:**

**Impact:**

**Proof of Concept:**

**Recommended Mitigation:**

### [L-1] `Fees::sellProfits` is missing a restriction, Protocol funds can be called by anyone to swap profits to WETH.

**Description:**

The `Fees::sellProfits` can be called by anyone to swap all protocol fees to WETH. Say maybe the attacker see that WETH prices tracking down, he could just sell all the profits to WETH there by reducing the value of the profits, although the protocol could swap back but some funds might be lost.

**Impact:**
There could be possible loss of value of funds that is if WETH prices are tracking down.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
The protocol can import Openzeppelin's Ownable2Step and add the onlyOwner modifier to the `Fees::sellProfits`, meaning only the owner can call the function

```diff
-   function sellProfits(address _profits) public {
+   function sellProfits(address _profits) public onlyOwner{
```

### [I-2] Floating pragmas

**Description:**
Contracts should use strict versions of solidity. Locking the version ensures the contract are not deployed with a different version than they were tested with. An incorrect version could lead to unintended results.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Lock up pragma versions.

```diff
-   pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
+   pragma solidity 0.8.19;
```

### [I-3] No `address(0)` checks
